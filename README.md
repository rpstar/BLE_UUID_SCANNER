This was made using AI and a LOT of back and forth. This just is an app that will scan for BLE devices and show the details.  You can prevent non-connectable devices from being shown in the results with the checkbox.

If you see any flaws or ways this should be done better please let me know as I wanted to put this up as another simple example as working on BLE even with AI help is frustrating to get right.
